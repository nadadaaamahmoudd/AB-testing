# Q2: Write a query and table creation statement to make final_assignments_qa look like the final_assignments table. If you discovered something missing in part 1, you may fill in the value with a place holder of the appropriate data type. 

Query: SELECT item_id,
       test_a AS test_assignment,
       'test_a' AS test_number,
       CAST('2020-01-01 00:00:00' AS timestamp) AS dummy_test_start_date
FROM dsv1069.final_assignments_qa
UNION ALL
SELECT item_id,
       test_b AS test_assignment,
       'test_b' AS test_number,
       CAST('2020-01-01 00:00:00' AS timestamp) AS dummy_test_start_date
FROM dsv1069.final_assignments_qa
UNION ALL
SELECT item_id,
       test_c AS test_assignment,
